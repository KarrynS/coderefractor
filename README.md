# 01 Homework Week 1: Code Refractor (HTML CSS GIT)

In this this we are asked to refractor an existing webpage to make it accessible. 

Web accessibility is important for businesses as it ensures people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. 

As front-end and junior developers we are ensuring the code meets certain set of standards whilst also improving the codebase for long term sustainability. Areas of focus are ensuring all links are functioning correctly, clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elemets, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

When working on some else's code apply the Scouts Rule - Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.
