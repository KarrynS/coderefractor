# 01 Homework Week 1: Code Refractor (HTML CSS GIT)

In this this we are asked to refractor an exisitng webpage to make it accessible. 

Web accesseibility is important for businesses as it ensures people woth disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. 

As front-end and junior developers we are ensuring the code meets certain set of standards whilst also imrpoving the codebase for long term sustainability. Areas of focus are ensringall links are functioning correctly, clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolifatin CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elemets, and ncluding comments before each element or section of the page.

When workign on some els'es code apply the Scouts Rule - Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.
